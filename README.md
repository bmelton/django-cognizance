Cognizance is a versioned news/blog engine for Django.  

Basically, it saves a copy of every version of every post and (optionally) 
makes those revisions available for view by users. 

It's nowhere near ready for production just yet, so I wouldn't even think
about using it, or even looking at the code, which will probably kill you with 
its vile sorcery.
